In this project, you will implement a client and a server
which use TCP to transmit a file from the server to the client.
Both the client and the server will run on the course VM
{\em cisc450.cis.udel.edu},
but they should be written in such a way that they could
conceivably be run on any two hosts, not necessarily the same.
For convenience, both the hostname and the server
port number may be hardcoded into both client and server,
but this should be done in such a way that they should
be easy to change.

The server starts by waiting for a connection request from the client. %printin

The client starts by prompting the user to enter 
%the hostname and port number for the server. 
%It then prompts the user to enter
the name of the file to be transferred. The client then sends a connection
request to the server.  After the connection is established, the client sends a
filename to the server. The server reads the file and sends it to the client in
a series of packets as described below. The client receives the file and stores
it with the name {\em out.txt}.
When the file transfer is complete, both the client 
and the server terminate execution.
